## Enhanced SNMP Profiles
Updated all device profiles to include:

1. **CDP Tables**: Device neighbor discovery and topology mapping
2. **High-Resolution Counters**: 64-bit interface statistics for accurate monitoring
3. **Enhanced Interface Metrics**: 
   - ifHCInOctets/ifHCOutOctets (64-bit byte counters)
